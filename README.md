## Traffic Sign Classifier

Convolutional Nueral Network to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). The model is based on the famous [LeNet-5 architecture]()

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* Numpy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* Jupyter Notebook
* sklearn, skimage
* [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which the images have been resized to 32x32.

Note: Udacity has a nice Anaconda environment that includes many of the dependencies used in the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)

## Running the code 
The project is completed in a Jupyter notebook. 
To start Jupyter in your browser, run the following command at the terminal prompt and within your Python 3 environment:

`> jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.
